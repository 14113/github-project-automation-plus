# GitHub Project Automation+

> ðŸ¤– Automate GitHub Project cards with any webhook event

This action allows you to use any of the `pull_request` and `issue` [webhook events](https://help.github.com/en/articles/events-that-trigger-workflows#webhook-events) to automate your project cards. For example when an `issue` is `opened` create a card in the Backlog project, Triage column.

If the `pull_request` or `issue` has a card it will be moved to the column provided. Otherwise the card will be created in the column.


## Usage

1. Create a new workflow by adding `.github/workflows/backlog-automation.yml` to your project. 
2. Create a [project](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-project-boards) with Columns set up in your repository or organisation.
3. In the `backlog-automation.yml` you have to decide what events and actions are going move an issue or pull request to a column.


_For example:_

To move opened issues into the Triage column and assigned pull requests into the To Do column of the Backlog project. You would add the following to the `backlog-automation.yml` file:

```yml
name: Automate project columns

on: [issues, pull_request]

jobs:
  automate-project-columns:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Move new issues into Triage
        if: github.event_name == 'issues' && github.event.action == 'opened'
        uses: alex-page/github-project-automation-plus@master
        with:
          project: Backlog
          column: Triage
          repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Move assinged pull requests into To do
        if: github.event_name == 'pull_request' && github.event.action == 'assigned'
        uses: alex-page/github-project-automation-plus@master
        with:
          project: Backlog
          column: To do
          repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```
